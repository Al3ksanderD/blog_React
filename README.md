# Welcome to the Simple React Blog!
My goal in making this app was to deep dive into learning how to write React. Thatâ€™s why my goal was to create a simple but working and nice-looking blog.
## Functionality

- Adding posts
- Deleting posts
- Post count
- Editing posts
- Post comments

## Future Plans
The next step in working on this project is to implement a real-time working backend with all its features, such as a user login system.
